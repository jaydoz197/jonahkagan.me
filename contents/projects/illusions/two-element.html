<p>
2-element tilt illusions are illusions consisting of an arrangement of lines that cause one of the lines to tilt more or less than it does in its actual orientation. The "2 elements" refer to the black lines and the white background. They don't actually have to be black and white for the effect to work, but they must have a significant luminance difference &mdash; that is to say, they must have high contrast. Black and white are, of course, the luminance/contrast extremes.
