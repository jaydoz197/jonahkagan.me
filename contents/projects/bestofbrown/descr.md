One day my friend asked me if there was a list of the best
courses at Brown. Since I couldn't think of any, I decided to
make Best of Brown. It uses a simple heuristic to determine the
best classes: each student is asked to pick their three favorite
classes, and each class is ranked by how many times it was
picked.
