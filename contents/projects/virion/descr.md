Virion is an educational game about basic immunology. Instead of
playing as the human body fighting off evil illnesses, you join
the dark side, playing as a virus trying to infect as many cells
as possible. Virion won the 2011 Hidden Agenda Contest.

I conceived and coded the game with [Varun
Singh](http://varunsingh.me).  We used
[Processing.js](http://processingjs.org) to implement the whole
thing using HTML5 technology (take that, Flash games!). [Charis
Loke](http://charisloke.com) created the art, and [Johnny
Koh](http://jvkoh.com) composed the music.
