This was a senior project at [Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences](http://xrds.org). My friend [Gage Boozan](http://soundcloud.com/gage-boozan) and I stopped attending classes for the last six weeks of the school year and instead spent all day inside a tiny, unused weight room building machines.
