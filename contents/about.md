title: About

### Hi, my name's Jonah.

I like to make things using code, words, and pretty much
anything else I can get my hands on. Right now I'm a student at
[Brown University](http://brown.edu), where I study pretty much
anything I want (but officially, [Computer
Science](http://cs.brown.edu)).

Do you make things? **Let's work together**. I'm up for (you
guessed it) pretty much anything.
