btnText: Try the prototype 
---

Inspired by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com), the Cal-cool-ator is an
attempt to transform the traditional graphing calculator into a
more powerful pedagogical tool. While most calculators let
students turn an equation into a graph, the Cal-cool-ator allows
students to create and modify functions using an equation, graph, or
table representation. When one representation changes, the others
update instantly.

[Jessica Liu](http://cakefordinner.com/), Clara Kliman-Silver, and I
designed and created a [prototype](http://jonahkagan.github.com/calcoolator/). We also wrote [a
paper](calcoolator/calcoolator-paper.pdf) explaining some of the
motivation and ideas behind the project. (Beware, it's a very rough
prototype!)
