One of the reasons I love Brown University is that I got to take
quirky courses like the one I took on optical illusions, which was
co-taught by [Leslie
Welch](http://www.brown.edu/Departments/CLPS/people/leslie-welch), a
professor of Cognitive Science, and Carl Fasano, a professor of art at
RISD.

For my final project for the course, I used
[Processing.js](http://processingjs.org) to create some interactive
illusions.  I first replicated some classic illusions, allowing you to
tweak the illusion using the arrow keys to see how the different
components of the image combine to create the effect. Then I played
around and came up with some new illusions by combining and remixing
others.
