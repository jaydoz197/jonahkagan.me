*Donner Party: The Musical* is a retelling of the classic folktale
in mini-musical form. Isaac Goldberg and I created the show
together; he composed the music, while I wrote the lyrics and
book. It was produced for the

Fifth Annual Mini-Musical Festival by an awesome group of actors
under the direction of Michelle Migliori.
