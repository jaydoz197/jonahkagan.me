I've made crossword puzzles for the [New York
Times](http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/jonah-kagan/), the [Brown
Daily Herald](http://acrosstobear.wordpress.com/). Some of my puzzles
were recently published in
[Word.](http://www.amazon.com/Word-Crossword-Puzzles-Prove-Square/dp/0761167552),
a book of crosswords by young constructors created by Natan Last.

Here are some puzzles in .puz and .pdf format. You can solve
.puz files on your computer by downloading
[Across Lite](http://www.litsoft.com/across/alite/download/)
(it's free!).
