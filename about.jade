    ### Hi, my name's Jonah.

    I like to make things using code, words, and pretty much
    anything else I can get my hands on. Right now I'm a student at
    [Brown University](http://brown.edu), where I study pretty much
    anything I want (but officially, [Computer
    Science](http://cs.brown.edu)).

    Do you make things? **Let's work together**. I'm up for (you
    guessed it) pretty much anything.
