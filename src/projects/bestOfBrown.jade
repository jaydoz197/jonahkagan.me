    One day my friend asked me if there was a list of the best
    courses at Brown. Since I couldn't think of any, I decided to
    make Best of Brown. It uses a simple heuristic to determine the
    best classes: each student is asked to pick their three favorite
    classes, and each class is ranked by how many times it was
    picked.
