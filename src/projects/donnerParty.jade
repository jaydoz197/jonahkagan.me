    *Donner Party: The Musical* is a retelling of the classic folktale
    in mini-musical form. Isaac Goldberg and I created the show
    together; he composed the music, while I wrote the lyrics and
    book. It was produced for the
    [Brownbrokers](http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Theatre_Speech_Dance/about/brownbrokers.html)
    Fifth Annual Mini-Musical Festival by an awesome group of actors
    under the direction of Michelle Migliori.
